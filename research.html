  My interests lie in complexity theory and my current projects span approximation algorithms and hardness of approximation, coding theory and analysis of boolean functions. Below are the problems I have worked on. Please feel free to contact me if you have any interesting ideas, or would just like to know more about these problems.

<h3>On the Senstivity Conjecture for kth Order Moments</h3>
 <p>In this internship, I am working with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/satya/">Dr. Satya Lokam</a> on the sensitivity conjecture. The degree of a binary function is the degree of the unique polynomial representing it in the Fourier basis, while its sensitivity is the maximum degree of the graph when represented on the boolean hypercube. The sensitivity of a function is upper bounded by a polynomial in its degree. In 1992, Nisan and Szegedy <a href="http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01263419#page-1">conjectured</a> that there also exists a polynomial relation relating the analytic and the combinatorial notions, and this problem is open ever since. This problem is interesting because degree is polynomially related to a variety of other important complexity measures like decision tree depth, approximate degree, certificate complexity, influence moment, etc. </p>
 
 <p> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07432">Recent results</a> try to explore a robust version of the conjecture and the effort is in bounding the influence moments by a sufficiently high moment of sensitivity. We are trying to extend this approach to get better bounds on the depth of the decision tree computing the function, among other things.
 
 <h3>A Brief Study of Codes that Achieve Capacity on Symmetric Channels</h3>
 <p>Claude Shannon introduced the notion of a channel to model real world transmission of messages and proved a lower bound on the amount of redundancy that needs to be added to a code to make sure we can decode it correctly. He also showed that there exists a code which achieves this goal, using probabilistic arguments.</p>
 
 <p>Efficiently decodable deterministic coding schemes had been elusive until 2008, when Arikan came up with his landmark <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3917">polar coding scheme</a>. Following this, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4321" >Guruswami et. al</a> improved the speed of polarization via analysis which does not rely on the martingale convergence theorem which Arikan did in his paper. </p>
 <p>It has been a long standing open question whether Reed Muller codes achieve capacity in the constant rate regime. As recent as STOC 2016, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04689">Kudekar et. al</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05123">Kumar et. al</a> independently showed that they indeed do so. A brief <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01439"target="_blank">survey</a> of the area focussing on the aforementioned results was done, as part of the Visiting Students Research Program, TIFR, under the guidance of <a href="http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~prahladh/">Prof. Prahladh Harsha</a>. I would like to take this forward and continue working on combinatorial aspects of RM codes.</p>

<h3>The Sum of Squares Hierarchy and its Connections to Approximation Algorithms</h3>

<p> Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems try to relax integer programs, and the effort is in rounding the solutions intelligently. <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~goemans/PAPERS/maxcut-jacm.pdf">Goemans and Williamson</a> demonstrated how lifting the problem into a higher dimension of semidefinite matrices and rounding the SDP by projecting the solutions down helps get better approxmation guarantees. The Pablo-Lasserre <a href="http://www.boazbarak.org/sos/prev/">Sum of Squares</a> hierarchy of relaxations tries to generalize this and the approximation guarantees for the first couple of levels of SoS matches the best known till date. It is thus a promising candidate as a meta algorithm which would give optimal gurantees for a variety of problems, not to mention that it also acts as a refutation scheme. In this reading project, I studied the SoS method applied to problems like MAXCUT, sparsest cut, sparse vector recovery, etc. under the guidance of <a href="http://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~prahladh/">Prof. Prahladh Harsha</a>. I am currently working on approximation algorithms for interference in wireless networks via SoS as part of my senior thesis, with <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/"> Prof. Radhakrishna Ganti</a>.</p>

<h3>Development of Distributed Algorithms for Dispersion of Robots</h3>
<p>Load balancing is an important problem in distributed computing which has enormous applications in practice. The problem is about minimizing the requests that each server is required to process at any given moment, in an online sense. I worked towards getting deterministic algorithms for the offline version of the problem, in which requests can be thought of as agents traversing the underlying graph which connects the servers, under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/augustineiitm/">Prof. John Augustine</a>.</p>

<h3>Lower Bounds for Property Testing via Communication Complexity (course project) </h3>
<p>As a part of the <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~jayalal/teaching/home.php?courseid=38">Communication Complexity</a> course I took, I studied how to prove <a href="http://cs.au.dk/~jbrody/papers/PTviaCC-conference.pdf">property testing lower bounds via communication complexity</a> and gave a talk on it, under the guidance of <a href="http://theory.cse.iitm.ac.in/memberdetails.php?memberid=1"> Prof. Jayalal Sarma</a>.</p>

<h3>A Brief Survey of Zero Knowledge Protocols for 3-color (course project)</h3>
 <p>As a part of the <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~jayalal/teaching/home.php?courseid=31">Advanced Complexity Theory</a> course, I studied zero knowledge proofs for the coloring problem and gave a talk on it, under the guidance of <a href="http://theory.cse.iitm.ac.in/memberdetails.php?memberid=1"> Prof. Jayalal Sarma</a>.</p>
